    "#### Overview\n",
    "- This code can be used to make multiple maps at once that plot longitude/latitude points and shade in land areas (aka choropleth maps). \n",
    "- Do not touch any other programs accept this one.\n",
    "- See [ENTER VIDEO PATH HERE] for an instructional video on how use this program BEFORE you run this program.\n",
    "- Email claire.erba@nera.com with any issues you are experiencing or other features you want built out.\n",

    "#### Running the Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "- Begin by running the first cell below by clicking in the cell and then pressing Shift and then Enter. This imports the helper programs.\n",
    "- After the first cell runs, press Shift and then Enter in the second cell. This will make HTML versions of your map.\n",
    "- After the second cell runs, follow the instructions before the third cell. Once you have done that, press Shift and then Enter in the third cell. "
