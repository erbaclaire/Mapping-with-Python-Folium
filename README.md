# Mapping-with-Python-Folium

#### Make beautiful maps that can:
1. Plot (longitude, latitude) coordinate points
2. Shade in geographic areas based on the level of a numeric variable (choropleth maps)
3. Shade in geographic areas not based on any numeric variable (service area maps)

#### All you need to know and do is:
1. Add data to the "Data" sheets in the Excel files in the ./input folder. You can use the "README" and "Example" tabs for help on how your data should be organized.
⇥ * Start_Maps.xlsx (required) - This is the power center of your map making automation. You put the specs for each map you want made in this file.
⇥ * Lat_Long_Data.xlsx (optional) - Data for plotting coordinates on the map.
⇥ * Color_Map.xlsx (optional) - Can give different coordinates different colors based on a "Label" variable in your Lat_Long_Data.xlsx file.
⇥ * Choro_Map.xlsx (optional) - Shade in geographic areas based on the level of some variable (e.g., choropleth maps).
⇥ * SA_Data.xlsx (optional) - Shade in geographic areas not based on the level of some variable (e.g., service area maps).
  
2. Run the code in a Jupyter notebook
  * Navigate to the "./programs" directory.
  * Open map_maker.ipynb in a Jupyter notebook.
  * Follow directions in the Jupyter notebook.
